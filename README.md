#Data Visualization Template

The project uses the following libraries:
create-react-app
victory-react         for Charts
leaflet               for Map tooltips
dotted-map            to create svg map
material-Ui           for design
styled-components     for mapContainer

The project shows a template which is able to help in data visualization by help of maps, and various charts. There are also various areas to show key indices. The following led to its completion:

1. Understanding: Due to less experience in dealing with styles that require data visulaziation, I carried out research at first to understand how its done. Thus, I also looked at various libraries that can build modular graphs and also a way to convert the map into an svg file.

2. Hit/Trial: A hit and trial approach to work with new found libraries led me to create the project while getting a deeper understanding. At start the first steps were creating the map with colored tiles along with making a framework for where differnt widgets will be placed.

3. The third step was making the framework. I set up the navigation tab along with routes. The overview page was divided into two pages. I started working on the second page after completing the information display section in the first page. The bubblechart and worldmap sections were divided into two pages. I also experimented with various options to try to create svg or edit the graphs component

4. The fourth step was creating a modal bubble chart. This step allowed me to effectively learn the new library and also gave me ideas about how to work better.

5. The fifth step was copying and editing the source file of dotted-map library to add shadows in the svg. The svg was then used in leaflet which allowed creation of tooltips over the selected cities. Data of world population was used in pinning and colored tiles for the map. I worked on creating mock line charts for widget on the second page.

6. After that I completed the bubble map and setup its cordinates. Along with that the step invovled tracing the shadow options and gradients in the svgs which were given in the file. After that I completed the cards.

7. Completion: After following these, I focused on skiming through whole project. Added a prompt to go to overview section. I also checked the working and thus completed the project.


My approach:

The task was challenging and also allowed me to explore various new libraries and technologies. I learned various things while also working on it. While I looked into it, I searched for optimal libraries and learned while working on it. This led me to work on creation of project as well as learn them. While working I often stumbled on some dead end but still worked through various ways.
